 - https://github.com/akanametov/yolo-face
 - https://github.com/Fuyucch1/yolov8_animeface/releases/tag/v1 (Anime Face)
  
Models should be placed in the `models/yolo-face/` directory.

#### YOLO Models
You'll need to download some YOLO models. You can find some from:
 - https://github.com/akanametov/yolo-face

### FUSEKSampler (Generic)

A generic version of the FUSEKSampler designed for use with any YOLO detection model, not just face-specific ones. This node provides the same sampling capabilities as the original FUSEKSampler but with more generic parameter naming to avoid confusion when working with non-face detection models.

**Use Cases:**
- Hand detection and enhancement
- General object isolation and processing
- Any scenario where you need to detect, crop, and enhance specific objects in images

## Workflows

You can find example workflows in the `workflows` [directory](/workflows).

## Known Issues

### Torch 2.6+ Compatibility

Torch 2.6+ versions will not allow loading pickles with Ultralytics due to security restrictions. This may cause issues when loading YOLO models. A pull request has been submitted to address this issue:

- **Issue**: Ultralytics pickle loading incompatibility with Torch 2.6+
- **Status**: PR submitted to Ultralytics: https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/pull/21260
- **Workaround**: Consider using Torch versions < 2.6 if you encounter pickle loading errors.

## Requirements

- Python >= 3.10
- torch
- numpy
- Pillow
- scipy
- ultralytics (YOLO)
- segment-anything (SAM)
